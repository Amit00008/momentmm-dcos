## 3.1 Getting Started: Onboarding & Dashboard Overview

The organizer experience begins inside the **Momentmm web portal**. After creating your profile, connect a secure cryptocurrency wallet—this address receives primary sale revenue and every automated royalty payment from secondary activity.

Once authenticated, the dashboard becomes your command center:

- **Events:** Launch new events and manage existing drops, including tier inventories and minting status.
- **Analytics:** Monitor real-time primary and secondary performance, revenue, and demand signals.
- **Royalties:** View a transparent ledger of downstream royalties, including splits across collaborators.
- **Community:** Access on-chain attendee rosters, segment fans, and initiate airdrops.
- **Settings:** Manage organization details, payouts, integrations, and API credentials.

> **Tip:** Store a backup signing wallet for finance teams so payout addresses and royalty splits can be updated without disrupting live sales.

## 3.2 Event Creation & Ticket Minting

Momentmm keeps event setup straightforward while leaving pricing and distribution choices with you.

1. **Define Event Parameters** – Provide name, description, schedule, venue, capacity, and category. Rich descriptions improve marketplace discoverability.
2. **Design NFT Artwork** – Upload custom images, motion assets, or branding. High-quality art increases collectible value and resale demand.
3. **Establish Pricing Tiers** – Configure face value, available quantity, and release windows for each tier (Early Bird, GA, VIP, etc.).
4. **Preview & Mint** – Once satisfied, mint the collection. Each ticket is created as a unique ERC‑721 token on Polygon with immutable metadata and artwork hashes stored on decentralized storage.

After minting, tickets are immediately ready for sale in both primary and Organizer-approved secondary channels.

## 3.3 The Rules Engine: Programming Fairness

Momentmm’s rules view lets you set the practical limits of your event without writing Solidity.

### Resale Price Controls

Set hard price ceilings (e.g., 110% of face value). Overpriced listings are rejected on-chain, neutralizing scalpers while still allowing legitimate fan-to-fan transfers.

### Automated Royalties & Splits

Define perpetual royalty percentages that execute automatically on every resale. Split those proceeds across multiple wallets—organizers, artists, venues, production partners, or charitable causes—with transparent, instant settlement.

### Additional Guardrails

- **Transfer Windows:** Control when tickets can be resold or transferred.
- **Whitelist Rules:** Restrict high-demand drops to preapproved wallets.
- **Bulk Policies:** Require discrete transfers for group purchases to preserve individual identity at the gate.

Together, these controls let organizers manage their own secondary markets instead of relying on third parties.

## 3.4 Analytics & Fan Insights

Legacy ticketing obscures the journey between purchase and attendance. Momentmm reveals it in real time.

### Primary Market Signals

- Sales velocity across tiers and time slices
- Conversion rates from campaign sources
- Geographical distribution and on-platform traffic patterns

### Secondary Market Intelligence

- Live resale volume and turnover ratios
- Average resale price versus contract cap
- Inventory retention, highlighting loyal holders versus resellers

### Verifiable Attendee Roster

Track the **current** owner of every ticket, not just the initial purchaser. Export wallet lists to segment superfans, build loyalty programs, or trigger compliance workflows.

Use these insights to calibrate pricing, schedule drops, and refine marketing campaigns for future events.

## 3.5 Building Community After the Event

When the doors close, the relationship continues. Every scanned ticket becomes a living credential inside the fan’s wallet.

### Airdrop Playbooks

- **Loyalty Tokens:** Celebrate multiple attendances with tiered badges.
- **Discount Passes:** Distribute NFT vouchers for merchandise or future events.
- **Exclusive Media:** Share behind-the-scenes content or unreleased tracks.
- **Priority Access:** Grant pre-sale or VIP privileges for upcoming tours.

### Campaign Workflow

1. Filter verified attendees inside the Community tab.
2. Segment by loyalty tier, geography, or attendance history.
3. Draft the reward (NFT, access code, token).
4. Launch the airdrop and monitor redemption metrics.

> **Remember:** Because ownership is verifiable, you can always reach genuine supporters even if they change email addresses or social handles.
