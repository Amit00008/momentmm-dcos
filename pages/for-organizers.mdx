## The Rules Engine: Programming Fairness

This is Momentmm's most revolutionary feature‚Äîthe ability to program economic rules directly into your tickets' smart contracts.

### Setting Resale Price Caps

Combat scalping with unbreakable price controls:

```solidity
// Example: 110% maximum resale price
setResaleRules(
  maxPrice: 1100, // 110% of face value (1100 basis points)
  royaltyFee: 500 // 5% royalty fee (500 basis points)
)
```

**How it works:**
- Any attempt to list above the cap is automatically rejected

- Fans are protected from predatory pricing
- Your event's intended pricing structure is preserved
