# Getting Started

Welcome to Momentmm! This guide will help you understand the platform and get started quickly, whether you're an event organizer, fan, or developer.

## Understanding Momentmm

### What Makes Us Different?

Momentmm represents a fundamental shift from traditional ticketing to **NFT-based digital assets**. Unlike conventional tickets that are merely access permissions, Momentmm tickets are:

- **Unique Digital Assets**: Each ticket is a one-of-a-kind NFT stored on the blockchain
- **Truly Owned**: You have complete control and ownership of your tickets
- **Programmable**: Smart contracts enforce fair resale rules automatically
- **Collectible**: Tickets become digital memorabilia after the event
- **Revenue-Generating**: Creators earn royalties on every resale, forever

### The Technology Behind It

Momentmm is built on **Polygon**, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that provides:

- **Low Fees**: Transaction costs are fractions of a cent
- **High Speed**: Fast transaction processing for smooth user experience
- **Security**: Benefits from Ethereum's security while being more scalable
- **Accessibility**: Easy integration with familiar payment methods
