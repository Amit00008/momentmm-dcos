Welcome to the reference site for **Momentmm.xyz**, a ticketing platform that uses blockchain records to make event access clear, verifiable, and fair for everyone involved.

## 1. Understanding Momentmm

### 1.1 What Is Momentmm?

Momentmm stores every ticket as a **Non-Fungible Token (NFT)** instead of a PDF or static QR code. Each NFT is minted on Polygon, assigned to the fan’s wallet, and carries the event details, artwork, and rules that govern how it can be used or resold. Because ownership sits on-chain, a ticket cannot be forged or duplicated, and its full history is easy to verify.

For organizers, this means they keep visibility into the full lifecycle of each ticket. For fans, it means the pass they buy and bring to the venue is the same pass the smart contract recognises—no middle steps, forwarding, or guesswork.

### 1.2 The Problem: A Market Under Pressure

India’s live event market is expanding, but the systems that handle ticket sales have not kept up:

- Automated bots can buy more than **40%** of tickets for popular shows before fans even load the page.
- Platform crashes are common. During the 2025 Coldplay sale, **13 million** visitors competed for **150,000** seats and resale prices spiked from ₹12,500 to more than ₹700,000 within minutes.
- Duplicate PDFs and screenshots continue to appear at venue doors, forcing staff to play detective instead of focusing on entry.

These patterns erode trust and remove predictable revenue from the people organising the events.

### 1.3 The Solution: On-Chain Tickets With Built-In Rules

Momentmm locks the important steps of ticketing into smart contracts so the process is consistent end to end:

1. **Minting:** Organizers configure the event, upload artwork, and mint Polygon-based NFTs—one per seat.
2. **Sale:** Fans pay with UPI, cards, or crypto and receive the NFT in their wallet immediately.
3. **Authentication:** The mobile app generates a fresh QR code that verifies the wallet against on-chain ownership at the gate.
4. **Resale:** Fans can list tickets on the built-in marketplace, but only within the limits (price caps, royalty splits, transfer windows) that the organizer set during minting.

## 2. The Momentmm Advantage

Momentmm’s innovations realign incentives across the ecosystem, converting leakage into shared value for fans and creators alike.

### 2.1 Keeping Resale Prices Under Control

Resale caps exist inside the contract itself. If the organizer says a ticket can only be listed at 110% of face value, any higher price is blocked on-chain. Fans avoid price spikes and organizers keep the market predictable.

### 2.2 Sharing Secondary Revenue

Instead of ending the relationship at the first sale, organizers can take a small fee from every later resale. Royalties route automatically to the wallets you specify—artists, venues, production partners, or charity—without manual reconciliation.

### 2.3 Staying Connected With Attendees

Tickets that stay in a fan’s wallet after the show become a simple way to deliver future rewards: discounts, audio files, meet-and-greet invites, or early access codes. You talk directly to verified attendees instead of depending on third-party algorithms.

### 2.4 Transparent, Verifiable Markets

Every ticket transfer leaves an auditable record. Organizers can view the current holder list and resale volume without waiting for reports. Fans know the ticket they buy is authentic because ownership is visible on-chain.
