## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Contracts

The Momentmm protocol consists of several key smart contracts deployed on Polygon:

#### 1. MomentmmFactory Contract

```solidity
contract MomentmmFactory {
    function createEvent(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        string memory baseURI,
        address organizer,
        uint256 maxTickets,
        uint256 maxPrice,
        uint8 royaltyFeeBps
    ) external returns (address);
}
```

**Purpose**: Factory contract for deploying individual event contracts
**Features**:
- One-click event deployment
- Standardized contract templates
- Gas-efficient batch operations
- Upgradeable contract logic

#### 2. Event Contract (ERC-721)

Each event gets its own ERC-721 contract instance:

```solidity
contract EventContract is ERC721, Ownable {
    // Core ticket functions
    function mintTicket(address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function setResaleRules(uint256 maxPrice, uint8 royaltyFeeBps) external;
    
    // Verification functions
    function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function getResaleRules() external view returns (uint256, uint8);
    
    // Royalty functions
    function royaltyInfo(uint256 tokenId, uint256 salePrice) 
        external view returns (address, uint256);
}
```

**Purpose**: Individual event ticket management
**Features**:
- ERC-721 standard compliance
- Custom resale rules enforcement
- Automated royalty distribution
- Event-specific metadata

#### 3. Marketplace Contract

```solidity
contract Marketplace {
    function listTicket(
        address nftContract,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 price
    ) external;
    
    function buyTicket(
        address nftContract,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) external payable;
    
    function executeResale(
        address nftContract,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 price,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external;
}
```

**Purpose**: Secondary market operations
**Features**:
- Automated price cap enforcement
- Instant royalty distribution
- Meta-transaction support
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

## NFT Ticket Lifecycle

### 1. Minting Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Organizer
    participant F as Factory Contract
    participant E as Event Contract
    participant IPFS as IPFS Storage
    
    O->>F: createEvent(parameters)
    F->>E: deploy new contract
    F->>E: setResaleRules(maxPrice, royalty)
    O->>E: mintTicket(to, tokenId)
    E->>IPFS: store metadata
    E->>E: emit TicketMinted event
```

**Technical Details**:
- Each ticket gets unique `tokenId`
- Metadata stored on IPFS with immutable hash
- Initial ownership assigned to organizer
- Resale rules embedded in contract

### 2. Primary Sale Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant F as Fan
    participant M as Marketplace
    participant E as Event Contract
    participant P as Payment Processor
    
    F->>M: purchaseTicket(tokenId)
    M->>P: process payment
    P->>M: payment confirmed
    M->>E: safeTransferFrom(organizer, fan, tokenId)
    E->>E: emit Transfer event
    M->>F: ticket in wallet
```

**Technical Details**:
- Atomic transaction ensures payment before transfer
- Payment processed off-chain for speed
- On-chain transfer provides ownership proof
- Gas fees covered by platform for user experience

### 3. Verification Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Attendee
    participant S as Scanner App
    participant E as Event Contract
    participant B as Blockchain
    
    A->>S: present QR code
    S->>S: decode wallet signature
    S->>B: query ownerOf(tokenId)
    B->>S: return current owner
    S->>S: verify signature matches owner
    S->>S: grant/deny entry
```

**Technical Details**:
- Dynamic QR codes prevent screenshot fraud
- Wallet signature proves ownership
- Blockchain query confirms current owner
- Instant verification with gas-free read operations

### 4. Secondary Market Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Seller
    participant B as Buyer
    participant M as Marketplace
    participant E as Event Contract
    
    S->>M: listTicket(tokenId, price)
    M->>E: getResaleRules()
    E->>M: return (maxPrice, royaltyFee)
    M->>M: verify price <= maxPrice
    B->>M: buyTicket(tokenId)
    M->>E: safeTransferFrom(seller, buyer, tokenId)
    M->>E: distribute royalties
```

**Technical Details**:
- Price cap enforcement prevents scalping
- Automated royalty distribution
- Atomic transactions ensure security
- All operations recorded on blockchain

## Gasless Transactions (Meta-Transactions)

One of the most significant barriers to mainstream Web3 adoption is the concept of gas fees. Momentmm solves this through meta-transactions, creating a gasless experience for end-users.

### Technical Implementation

```solidity
contract MetaTransactionReceiver {
    function executeMetaTransaction(
        address userAddress,
        bytes memory functionSignature,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s,
        uint8 v
    ) external payable {
        bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
            "\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32",
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
                userAddress,
                functionSignature,
                nonces[userAddress]
            ))
        ));
        
        require(ecrecover(hash, v, r, s) == userAddress, "Invalid signature");
        nonces[userAddress]++;
        
        (bool success,) = address(this).call(abi.encodePacked(functionSignature, userAddress));
        require(success, "Function call failed");
    }
}
```

### Meta-Transaction Flow

1. **User Action**: User initiates action in app (e.g., transfer ticket)
2. **Transaction Construction**: App creates transaction data without sending to blockchain
3. **User Signing**: User signs transaction data with private key (no gas required)
4. **Relayer Submission**: Signed data sent to trusted relayer service
5. **Gas Payment**: Relayer pays MATIC gas fees from platform pool
6. **Execution**: Relayer executes transaction on blockchain
7. **Verification**: Smart contract verifies signature and executes function

### Benefits

- **User Experience**: Seamless Web2-like experience
- **Cost Efficiency**: Platform absorbs gas costs
- **Scalability**: Can handle high-volume operations
- **Accessibility**: No need for users to hold MATIC tokens

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security

#### 1. Smart Contract Security

```solidity
// Example security measures
contract SecureEventContract {
    modifier onlyOrganizer() {
        require(msg.sender == organizer, "Only organizer");
        _;
    }
    
    modifier validPrice(uint256 price) {
        require(price <= maxResalePrice, "Price exceeds limit");
        _;
    }
    
    modifier nonReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "Reentrant call");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
