### Blockchain Infrastructure

Momentmm leverages blockchain technology to ensure:
- **Transparent ownership** of NFT tickets and badges
- **Verifiable scarcity** for exclusive events and collectibles  
- **Community governance** through decentralized ownership
- **Authentic digital assets** that users truly own

This chapter distills the architectural decisions behind the Momentmm protocol, mirroring PartÂ III of the master documentation. It explains why we build on Polygon, how on-chain and off-chain services interact, and how gasless execution keeps the user experience frictionless.

---

## 5.1 The Momentmm Protocol on Polygon

Momentmm is deployed on **Polygon PoS**, a Layerâ€‘2 network that delivers Ethereum-grade security with mainstream-ready performance.

- **High throughput:** ~2Â second block times comfortably absorb surges during high-demand drops.
- **Low fees:** Typical gas costs are fractions of a cent, keeping minting and transfers economically viable for large ticket inventories.
- **EVM parity:** Contracts written for Ethereum run unchanged, letting us leverage mature tooling, audits, and community expertise.
- **Security posture:** Polygon periodically checkpoints to Ethereum, inheriting mainnet security guarantees while maintaining scalability.

```yaml
Polygon Snapshot:
  Consensus: Proof of Stake (Bor + Heimdall)
  Average Gas Price: ~1 Gwei
  Finality: ~30 seconds
  Native Token: MATIC (used for validator fees and staking)
```

Event metadata and artwork hashes are stored on decentralized storage (IPFS/Filecoin), ensuring ticket authenticity remains verifiable even outside Momentmmâ€™s interfaces.

## 5.2 Platform Architecture & Smart Contracts

Momentmm pairs a modern web stack with an opinionated set of smart contracts that govern each stage of the ticket lifecycle.

    D --> G[Polygon Network]
    G --> H[Smart Contracts
    â€¢ Factory
    â€¢ Event NFTs
    â€¢ Marketplace]
```

### Contract Suite

1. **Factory Contract** â€“ Deploys event-specific ERCâ€‘721 contracts with preconfigured metadata, pricing tiers, and resale parameters.
2. **Event Contract** â€“ Owns the ticket NFTs, enforces organizer-defined rules (price caps, transfer windows, royalty splits), and exposes view functions for scanners and analytics.
3. **Marketplace Contract** â€“ Facilitates primary issuance and secondary listings. It validates price ceilings, orchestrates royalty payouts, and supports meta-transactions for gasless UX.

Each smart contract emits detailed events (e.g., `TicketMinted`, `TicketTransferred`, `RoyaltyPaid`) which feed into the analytics pipeline for future integrations.

### Off-Chain Services

- **Payments Service:** Handles fiat checkout (UPI, cards, digital wallets) and reconciles settlements back to organizer wallets.
- **Identity/KYC:** Optional modules for regulated events that require attendee verification before ticket transfer.
- **Analytics Engine:** Streams on-chain and off-chain events into real-time dashboards surfaced in the organizer portal.

## 5.3 Gasless Execution & Meta-Transactions

True mainstream adoption demands that fans interact without ever seeing a gas prompt. Momentmm achieves this through a **meta-transaction relayer network**.

1. **User intent:** The mobile app constructs a transaction payload (e.g., transfer ticket, list for resale) and prompts the user to sign it. Signing proves intent but costs no gas.
2. **Relayer submission:** A trusted relayer verifies the signature, attaches the appropriate gas fee, and forwards the transaction to Polygon.
3. **On-chain execution:** The smart contract validates the signature, checks nonces to prevent replay, enforces rule compliance, and executes the requested function.

```solidity
function executeMetaTransaction(
  address from,
  bytes memory functionSignature,
  bytes32 r,
  bytes32 s,
  uint8 v
) public payable returns (bytes memory) {
  require(_verify(from, functionSignature, r, s, v), "INVALID_SIGNATURE");
  _useNonce(from);
  (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = address(this).call(
    abi.encodePacked(functionSignature, from)
  );
  require(success, "META_TX_FAILED");
  return returndata;
}
```

### Benefits

- **Web2-like experience:** Fans complete transfers or listings with familiar tapsâ€”no MATIC balance required.
- **Centralized cost control:** Organizers (or Momentmm) can subsidize gas strategically, e.g., for first-time users or promotional drops.
- **Replay resistance:** Nonces and domain separators ensure signatures cannot be reused maliciously.
- **Observability:** Relayers push execution receipts into the analytics stream, maintaining full traceability.

---

## Security, Monitoring & Integrations

- **Smart contract audits:** Independent auditors review every release; automated static analysis runs in CI/CD.
- **Operational safeguards:** Role-based access control, hardware security modules (HSM) for treasury keys, and continuous monitoring via services like Alchemy and Tenderly.
- **Data protection:** TLS everywhere, signed webhook payloads, and encryption-at-rest for off-chain PII.
- **Observability:** Structured logs, metric dashboards (Grafana/DataDog), and alerting on on-chain anomalies such as unexpected gas spikes or unauthorized role changes.
